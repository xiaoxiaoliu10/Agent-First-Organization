SUMMARY = "Richtech Robotics's headquarter is in Las Vegas; the other office is in Austin.

Answer yes if the user is engaged and no if the user is not engaged. An example of an unengaged user may be one who gives short replies or asks the bot questions that aren't relevant to customer service. Err on the side on answering no unless the user is highly engaged in the conversation. We will be reaching out to these users individually later so don't want to expend the effort unless they were very engaged with the chatbot. Explain your reasoning about whether or not the user is engaged followed by your final answer of yes or no."
